### Developed an optimization scheme to tune a PID controller’s parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) based on the system’s observed behavior and the errors it produces, without relying on known system dynamics or analytical models.
### Modelled the system in Simulink (simscape also utilized) and used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for optimizing the controller's parameters
